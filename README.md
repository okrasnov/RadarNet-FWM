# RadarNet-FWM
## Forward Model of Radar Signals in the Distributed Radar System

This is a simple simulator of the set of non-directive radars that are working simultaneously but independently and observes the same set of targets. 

The simulator generate a timeline of coherently processed bursts of sensing waveforms with specified parameters, which are presented as a set of received signals on the range-Doppler plane.
